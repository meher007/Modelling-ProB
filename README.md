# Modelling-ProB
ProB is an animator and model checker for the B-Method. It allows animation of many B specifications, and can be used to systematically check a specification for a range of errors. The constraint-solving capabilities of ProB can also be used for model finding, deadlock checking and test-case generation. 
The aim of this project was to develop an Electronic banking system specification by using Pro-B language and the model should contain operations of customer and admin or other related entities.
